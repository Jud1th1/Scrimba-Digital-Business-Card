## My process
- Learning React: I began by taking several lessons on Scrimba to familiarize myself with React and its core concepts.
- Project Setup: To streamline the project setup process, I opted to use CodeSandbox, which already includes React in one of its templates. This allowed me to quickly set up the necessary files and project structure.
- Component Layout: In the App.js file, I planned and organized the various components needed for the application, including the header, main section, and footer.
- Implementing Components: Using JSX, I implemented the header component and added a profile image. This component was later exported to the App.js file.
- Main Section and Footer: I utilized the same method of programming HTML code inside JavaScript to build the main section and footer components. Once completed, these components were exported to the App.js file.
- Styling: To enhance the design, I incorporated a Google font and selected a color palette from Coolors. I focused on principles such as balance, pattern, and hierarchy when arranging the text, buttons, and icons.
- Testing and Refinement: Throughout the development process, I tested the application's functionality and made necessary adjustments to ensure a smooth user experience.

### What I learned

-	Building this project provided me with valuable hands-on experience in using React to create a web application.
